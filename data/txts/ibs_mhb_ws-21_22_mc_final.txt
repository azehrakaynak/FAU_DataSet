Rückkehr in die Präsenzlehre  

Die FAU WiSo plant für das Wintersemester 2021/2022 die weitgehende Rückkehr zur 
Präsenzlehre, vor Ort auf dem Nürnberger City-Campus. Daher werden, solange es möglich 
ist und die entsprechenden Vorschriften es erlauben, alle Veranstaltungen in Präsenz 
abgehalten (nur für internationale Studierende wird es ein passendes digitales Angebot 
geben). Sollte es im laufenden Semester Phasen geben, in denen ein Präsenzbetrieb nicht 
zulässig oder nur eingeschränkt möglich ist, werden wir selbstverständlich die dann 
erforderlichen Lehrformate zur Verfügung stellen. 
Die FAU hat eine Corona-Satzung aufgrund von Einschränkungen im Lehr- und 
Prüfungsbetrieb durch das Corona-Virus SARS-CoV-2 veröffentlicht, die auch für das 
Wintersemester 2021/2022 Gültigkeit hat. Das Modulhandbuch in der vorliegenden Fassung 
enthält Corona-bedingte Änderungen an der Prüfungsform, die in den jeweiligen 
Modulbeschreibungen gekennzeichnet sind.    
Folgende Szenarien sind auf der Grundlage der Corona-Satzung möglich: 

  Prüfungsformate unverändert 

Das ursprünglich vorgesehene Prüfungsformat, z. B. eine Klausur bleibt bestehen. In 
diesen Modulbeschreibungen wurde keine Änderung vorgenommen. 

  Einmaliger Wechsel der Prüfungsform 

Der Wechsel der Prüfungsformate ist möglich, wenn die ursprünglich geplante 
Prüfungsform auf Grund des Corona-Virus nicht umsetzbar ist. Diese Änderungen 
finden Sie in den Modulbeschreibungen angeführt. Die ursprüngliche Prüfungsform 
wird bei dieser Variante durchgestrichen, die neue Prüfungsform ist in oranger 
Schriftfarbe angegeben.  

  Alternative Prüfungsformen verankern und später darüber entscheiden 

Die Satzung sieht eine weitere Option vor. Es können zwei Alternativen festgelegt 
werden. Die Entscheidung für die eine oder die andere Alternative trifft der 
Modulverantwortliche und ist den Studierenden spätestens vier Wochen vor der 
Prüfung bekannt zu geben. Hier bleibt die ursprüngliche Prüfungsform zunächst 
bestehen, darunter finden Sie die alternative Prüfungsform eingefügt, ebenfalls in 
oranger Schriftfarbe. Vier Wochen vor der Prüfung wird die finale Prüfungsform durch 
den Modulverantwortlichen bekannt gegeben. 

Im Informationssystem UnivIS finden Sie unter www.univis.fau.de für alle Veranstaltungen 
Angaben, in welchem Format (Präsenz, Online oder hybrid Online/Präsenz) die 
Lehrveranstaltungen abgehalten werden sowie Detailinformationen zum jeweiligen Online-
Format bzw. Informationen zu Zeit und Ort.  
Ausführlichere Informationen zu den Modulen finden Sie auch in den jeweiligen Kursen auf 
StudOn. Treten Sie daher unbedingt den Kursen bei, die Sie dieses Semester besuchen 
möchten. 
Weitere aktuelle Informationen entnehmen Sie bitte den Webseiten der Lehrstühle.

Please note 

Return to in-person teaching 

For the winter term 2021/22, FAU WiSo is planning to return to our City Campus in Nürnberg 
for in-person teaching. Therefore, all lectures will take place in person as far as the 
circumstances and regulations will allow (there will only be a suitable digital offer for 
international students). In case there are timeframes where regular teaching is not allowed or 
only possible to a limited extent, we will of course provide the respectively necessary 
teaching formats. 
Due to the restrictions in our teaching and examination activities caused by the corona virus 
SARS CoV-2, FAU has published a set of corona regulations. The module handbook in its 
present version contains changes in the examination method induced by corona, which are 
marked in the respective module description. 
Based on the corona regulations, the following scenarios are possible: 

  Examination method unchanged 

The originally intended examination method, e.g., an exam, persists. There are no 
changes to this module. 

  One-time change of the examination method 

Changes in the examination method are possible if the originally intended 
examination method is not realizable due to the corona virus. These changes can be 
found in the module description of the respective module. The original examination 
method is crossed out in this case, the new examination method is marked in orange 
font color. 

  Anchor alternative examination method and decide later 

The corona regulations allow for a third alternative. It is possible to set two alternative 
examination methods. The decision on one of the two alternatives is made by the 
respective responsible person for the module and must be communicated to the 
students at least four weeks before the examination takes place. In this case, the 
originally intended examination method remains in place and you will find the 
alternative examination method written below in orange font color. Four weeks before 
the examination, the final examination method will be announced by the responsible 
examiner. 

You can find detailed information on all lectures’ format (online, on-site, or hybrid), as well as 
date, time, and place on the information system UnivIS, available at www.univis.fau.de.  
More extensive information on the modules offered this term can also be found on StudOn. It 
is essential to join the courses you would like to attend on StudOn. 
Further current information can be found on each department’s websites.

This course deals with international trade policy. The focus will be 
on  the  political  and  economic  determinants  and  consequences  of 
trade  liberalization  as  well  as  trade  policies  that  increase  trade 
barriers. The course will provide important insights into the global 
governance  of 
the  World  Trade 
Organization  and  the  role  of  the  United  States,  China  and  the

During  the  past  decades,  operations  have  become  increasingly 
international  or  even  global  in  nature.  Drivers  of  the  globalization 
include increased competitiveness through offshore manufacturing 
and global sourcing.  
During this module, the increasing complexity and the challenges of 
operations  on  a  global  scale  will  be  discussed  together  with  the 
participants.  The  theory  modules  at  the  beginning  structure  the 
options  of  a  general  operations  strategy  and 
its 
implementation in the organization.   
The subject specific modules, elaborated by the participants, enable 
a  profound  understanding  of  single  activity  areas  of  global 
operations  and  their  relation  to  the  global  operations  strategy. 
Therewith  the  students  will  get  insights  in  the  importance  of  an 
integrated global operations strategy and will become familiar with 
the main strategic options in this field. 
Participation in the first seminar session is mandatory, as the 
topics for the teamwork are chosen during this session by the 
participants. 
In  the  following  weeks,  based  on  own  research  using  scientific 
sources, key topics are elaborated in teams. Following predefined 
learning  targets,  the  students  need  to  structure  the  elaborated 
content  in  an  academic  presentation  and  present  their  results  in 
class. Thereby, the teams are responsible for developing a didactic 
concept  in  order  to  support  the  understanding  of  the  discussed 
topics. Furthermore, the participants are required to document their 
research  method  as  well  as  their  results.  After  the  course,  the 
participants  are  able  to  discuss  the  functions  and  impact  of 
operations management in an international context.

  Contents  

The lecture focuses on the challenges of leading and 
communicating innovation and change in IT enabled companies 
and networked organizations. Based upon that, creating a 
sustainable innovative environment is a leadership task. In order to 
succeed at this task, leaders must develop innovative abilities to 
deal with the challenges inherent in a business environment 
characterized by fluid, unstructured and changing information. The 
aim of this course is thereby twofold.  
First, the course delineates and describes different yet emerging 
innovation tools, organizing them into a coherent set of classes. 
Each class of tools is described using a set of up-to-date business 
cases that depict the current status of the information systems.  
The second aim of this course is to get an overview of how to 
structure leadership systems towards innovation, how leaders can 
motivate to foster innovative thinking and what new forms of 
innovation (e.g. open innovation) mean for the definition of 
leadership.  
In doing so, this lecture represents an Idea Transformation Class 
as students are encouraged not only to merely develop, but to 
actively deploy specifically developed concepts. 

The students: 
• will understand and explore the theories and practicalities of 
leadership in open innovation contexts. 
• will gain knowledge on leading and communicating innovation 
and translate it in leadership behavior in real case contexts. 
• will learn to assess, reflect and feedback the impact of practical 
leadership for innovation. 
• can independently define new application-oriented problem 
solving in e-business in relation to the economic impact for 
businesses, along with solving problems using the appropriate 
methods. 
• discuss possible solutions in groups and present their research 
results. 

  Basic understanding of innovation management 
  Basic understanding of management processes 
  First experience in team projects

Service innovation  
This course is a core course for students who started 
studying the MIBS program in WS 2018 or later. 
Students who started in WS 2017 or earlier can include 
this course in their area studies only. 
Service innovation 

5 ECTS 

2,5 ECTS 
2,5 ECTS 

Prof. Dr. Möslein, Prof. Dr. Roth and colleagues 

Services now account for over 80% of all transactions in 
developed economies, but typically receive much less R&D 
attention than products. Developing service innovations demands 
a clear strategy from businesses with four interlocking core 
elements: search, selection, implementation and evaluation of 
innovative concepts. If even one of these phases is not been 
clearly thought through, the entire innovation process is likely to 
collapse. This course focuses on successful approaches, methods, 
tools and efforts to develop service innovations. 
Further information can be found on www.wi1.fau.de. 
The students can: 

 

 

learn about items, notions, characteristics and special 
features in innovation management for services, service 
design methods and cases. 
learn to judge and discuss innovation management tasks 
and alternative solutions with respect to the specialites of 
services. 

  experience methods of service design by themselves in 

interactive lectures, gain a feeling for suitable methods and 
learn to reflect different effects. 

  apply their knowledge and competences in  solving cases

This module focuses on one of the most important management 
tasks: to achieve change in organizations. It deals with systematic 
approaches to influence individuals, teams and the organization as 
a whole in a desired way – in order to develop a company from its 
current to a future state. The currently ongoing digital 
transformation makes this particularly worthwhile. Digitalization 
drives change and thus represents a great challenge, but also 
offers tremendous opportunities. The module provides participants 
with a  systematic approach in order to (1) successfully initiate and 
implement organizational changes and (2) successfully guide an 
organization through a change process. Participants will be 
provided with theoretical concepts and practical tools for managing 
organizational change (e.g. research on cognitive biases, trait 
theory, motivation theory, affective events theory, emotional 
intelligence, and organizational ambidexterity). 
At the end of this module, students are familiar with the tasks  and 
challenges of managing change in organizations. The  participants 
should develop an understanding of the importance of  successful 
leadership during organizational change as well as  evaluate 
situations, which are related to organizational change.

This course combines the perspectives of the ethics of competitive 
markets, business ethics, and corporate social responsibility. First, 
we address the question of how social and environmental objectives 
are  met  at  a  macro-level.  Here,  we  place  particular  emphasis  on 
national and supranational governance structures. In a second step, 
we  take  on  the  perspective  of  the  individual  firm  by  raising  the 
question as to if and to what extent firms need to incorporate moral 
issues into their value creation processes. Against this background, 
corporate  social  responsibility  may  serve  as  a  means  of 
implementing  these  moral  issues.  Thus,  we  take  a  closer  look  at 
CSR, its origins, development, and tools. 
Students: 

  Are able to provide differentiated arguments on questions 

relevant to our society 

  Have skills to critically reflect current issues in business 

ethics and CSR 

  Know concepts that help to critically reflect the role of 

business in society  

  Understand the changing environment of companies 
  Are able to use dilemma structure as analytical tool 
  Understand the CSR discourse and its core concepts

This  course  takes  a  closer  look  at  management  and  organization 
theories. Discussed in the context of organizations driven by a social 
or environmental mission, these theories provide insights into why 
organizations  exist,  how  they  function  and  how  they  interact  with 
each other. This course addresses theories such as transaction cost 
theory, agency theory or institutional theory. 
Studying  management  and  organizations 
the 
perspective  of  mission-driven  organization  helps  us  to  better 
understand 
i.e. 
simultaneously creating financial, social, and environmental value. 
These  insights  provide  insights  into  many  issues  that  companies 
face when implementing sustainability strategies.

Intellectual Properties (IPs) in general and especially patents play 
an important role in innovation in any Hightech society. This topic is 
multi-faceted and can be accessed from different viewpoints: 
business, politics, legal framework, organization, etc. In this course, 
we will focus on: 

- 
- 

- 

- 

the introduction to IPs and patents in general, 
the role of IPs and patents in research, development and 
(open) innovation, 
the patent exploitation through licensing contracts and 
patent pools,  
the patent policies in the European Union, China and USA. 

The students: 
 

learn to understand the role of patenting in the innovation 
process,  

  gain deeper insights into the roles of IP in various types of 

businesses,

The course analyzes topics in labor economics and their connection 
to innovation and technology. We will mostly discuss classical topics 
in  labor  economics  such  as  labor  supply  and  migration  which  are 
seen through a technology and knowledge economy perspective. It 
is mainly an empirical course: labor economics is a front-runner in 
the use of econometrics and data. 
Students  know  the  key  issues  in  the  intersection  of  labor  and 
innovation economics. They are able to assess current research in 
the  area  and  are  able  to  relate  its  results  to  fundamental  policy 
questions  in  the  area.  Students  are  acquainted  with  important 
empirical approaches in the area.

and transportation sectors, carbon pricing, integration and 
subsidization of renewable energies, and the effectiveness of 
different climate policies. 

  Students get to know fundamental problems of environmental 
economics  (e.g.  problems  of  air  pollution  from  burning  fossil 
fuels,  integration  of  renewable  energy  sources,  and  effective 
policy making) 

  Students  get  to  know  recent  econometric  approaches  to 

identifying the effects of environmental policies.

 Contents  

We cannot not negotiate - if we like it or not, we have to negotiate. 
As soon as we need the agreement of somebody in order to reach 
our own goal, we have to negotiate. The question is, how we can 
influence the negotiating process towards a solution which 
satisfies my interests as well as those of my counterpart. 
Especially in long-lasting relationships it is important to achieve a 
sustained Win-Win-Solution based on commonly shared values. 
Only then will both parties stock to the agreement and are willing 
to continue a good relationship with the other side.  

The Zurich Negotiating Model® / ZNM is based on the principles of 
the common Win-Win-Philosophy, which focusses on substance 
and relationship. The ZNM broadens this scope to include 
personality and values. Only in the combination of these four 
elements is the key for a sustainable success. As a 
comprehensive model for orientation and action in the negotiating 
process, as well as a tool for reflection and analysis during 
preparation or follow-up, the Zurich Negotiating Model® offers 
fresh options for a specific approach to overcoming resistance 
during difficult negotiations.

 Learning objectives and 
skills 

The participants learn a repertoire of skills for the methodical 
preparation, conduct and review of negotiations and have 
opportunities to engage in active training, with the option of basing 
this on situations they have experienced themselves.

The course focusses on dynamics in organizational transformation 
driven through information technology (IT) and consists of two 
parts. 

The first part introduces the topic from an industrial perspective 
and explores the re-organization of value streams in the course of 
the digital transformation. Teaching in this part includes contribu-
tions from a German automotive company. Students will work in a 
project-oriented mode for half the lecture and then present their 
results. 

The second part takes the perspective of academic research on 
the organization of the digital transformation. It introduces different 
theoretical frameworks to gain a deeper understanding of the phe-
nomenon and explores its implications for global business struc-
tures. Students write a short essay to show what they have 
learned. 

Together, the lecture allows the students to gain theoretical 
knowledge on the digital transformation and acquire practical prob-
lem-solving skills as well to work effectively on innovative projects 
in the field. 

The students 
  are familiar with different theories of works systems and 

service systems and their practical application 

  know more about the contribution of information technology in 

managing complex innovation activities 

  have an improved understanding of the global IT Industry and 

various strategies that are used   

  can identify and unravel the business problem in a case study 

and actively take part in class discussions  
  general knowledge of digital technology and their economic 

applications 

  basic understanding of simple software applications

5.  Contents 

The seminar provides content on the basics of sustainability 
management in research and practice. In close cooperation with 
our company partner Uvex, current challenges for sustainability 
within the company are identified and proposed solutions are 
developed.  
The first sessions serve to give an interactive introduction to the 
topic of sustainability and to harmonize the different levels of 
knowledge of students from different disciplines. Students will 
learn different concepts and tools of sustainability management. 
Thus, the seminar aims at a systematic understanding of relevant 
management tools and novel instruments across corporate 
functions to address sustainability issues. After a theoretical 
introduction, students will get familiar with the current sustainability 
issues at Uvex across the Triple Bottom Line dimensions. These 
projects focus on topics such as circular economy, sustainability 
communication or blockchain. The second part of the seminar 
aims at putting the theoretical knowledge into practice. To do so, 
students will work in project teams to find a practical solution to the 
sustainability issue identified at Uvex in cooperative coordination 
with the supervisors of the seminar. A midterm presentation gives 
the students the opportunity to receive feedback and iterate on 
their ideas. At the end of the seminar, there will be a final 
presentation and students prepare a documentation of their 
learning journey.

  Contents  

Preparing students for managerial careers and real-world 
situations provides challenging. One way to simulate real-world 
situations and to deep-dive in realistic problem scenarios is via 
case studies. The case study method is the most widely used 
method in academia for researchers interested in qualitative 
research. 

Case studies are in-depth studies of a person, group, organization, 
place, or event that allow the exploration and understanding of 
complex issues. In a case study, a real-time phenomenon is 
explored within its naturally occurring context, with the 
consideration that context will create a difference. Case studies 
are used to test new theories or ideas, or they can be utilized to 
improve on existing ideas and theories. Case studies are present 
in almost all fields of study, but are particularly prevalent in 
business, psychology, or sociology.

In this course, students will learn to craft their own case studies

In  this  course,  students  acquire  specialized  knowledge  and 
professional  skills  in  the  context  of  strategic  transformation. 
Participants can explain and reflect on megatrends as well as on the 
current  environments  of  European  firms.  On  the  basis  of  popular 
strategy  approaches,  students  are  able  to  derive  and  discuss 
strategic options for firms in order to respond to these challenges.  
Moreover, foundations of organisational and leadership approaches 
are taught in this course. Thereby, the students acquire knowledge 
and experience, how organisations prepare their organisations for 
transformation and find out, how people in the European context get 
prepared for transformation.  
Overall, this course is designed to enable students to deal with and 
identify  strategic  solutions  for  the  current  challenges  of  European 
firms.
